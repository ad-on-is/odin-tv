## Video Player

Odin TV **does not include a video player**, since there are better players out there that support audio-passthrough, etc, it is not worth the hassle to reinvent the wheel.

Recommended players:

- Just (default)
- Nova
- Kodi
- MX Player
- VLC

# Known issues

- The navigation is a bit wonky. This is due to Flutters lack of keyboard and D-Pad navigation. I'm working my ass of to make this as smooth as possible.
  - If you experience issues, just smash the buttons on your remote.
