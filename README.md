This is the Android TV app to enjoy Odin on your TV.

## Video Player

Odin TV **does not include a video player**, since there are better players out there that support audio-passthrough, etc, it is not worth the hassle to reinvent the wheel.

Recommended players:

- Just (default)
- Nova
- Kodi
- MX Player
- VLC
